                    <li>
                        <h3 class="legal">Use of the Platform and Acceptable Conduct</h3>
                        <p>You agree to use the Platform only for lawful, authorized, and proper purposes. You will not use the Platform to engage in deceptive, malicious, or illegal conduct, and you will not attempt to disrupt, interfere with, or compromise the security, integrity, or performance of the Platform or its underlying infrastructure. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: unauthorized access or data scraping, distribution of malware, distribution of unsolicited promotional materials, spoofing or impersonation, and any activity that violates the privacy or intellectual property rights of others.</p>
                        <p>We expressly prohibit any attempt to gain unauthorized access to restricted areas, systems, or data connected to the Platform. You must not attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Platform or circumvent authentication or security measures. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have engaged in prohibited activities, we may immediately suspend or terminate your access and take appropriate legal action.</p>
                        <p>The Platform may provide features that enable interactions between Users. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We do not endorse any User Content and do not assume responsibility for User-to-User communications or transactions. You agree to exercise caution when interacting with others, and you should never share sensitive personal or financial information with other Users.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3 class="legal">Purchases and One-Time Payments (User Buy)</h3>
                        <p>Where the Platform enables one-time purchases, you agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase information, including payment details, billing address and contact information. Payments may be processed through third-party payment processors. By making a purchase you represent that you have the legal right to use the chosen payment method and you authorize the Platform and its payment processors to charge the applicable fees, taxes, and any other charges as disclosed at the time of purchase.</p>
                        <p>All transaction pricing, fees, and availability are subject to change at our discretion, and we shall not be responsible for typographical errors in pricing or product descriptions. Receipts and order confirmations will be provided in a manner specified at the point of sale. In the event of a billing discrepancy, you must notify us promptly so we can investigate and attempt to resolve the issue.</p>
                        <p>Payment-related disputes may also be subject to the policies of the payment processor. We do not store full payment card data unless explicitly stated; where payment card details are stored, they will be protected using industry standard security measures and processors adhering to applicable security standards such as PCI-DSS.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3 class="legal">Subscription Plans and Recurring Billing (Subscription Plan)</h3>
                        <p>If you subscribe to any Subscription Plan, you agree that you will be billed on a recurring basis for the duration of your subscription. Subscription fees, billing intervals, and renewal terms will be clearly disclosed at the time you enroll. Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions will automatically renew until you cancel. You are responsible for cancelling your subscription prior to the renewal date to avoid charges for the following billing period.</p>
                        <p>We may change subscription pricing, features, or terms from time to time. We will provide reasonable notice of material changes and give subscribers the opportunity to cancel. Price changes will not affect any period you have already paid for, but will apply at the time of the next renewal. Failure to pay may result in suspension or termination of subscription services.</p>
                        <p>If you cancel your subscription, you may continue to have access to subscription features through the end of the then-current billing period, but you will not receive prorated refunds unless our Refund Policy specifies otherwise. Certain promotions or trial periods may have special terms – those terms will govern.</p>

                        <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, %%DOMAIN_NAME%% grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Platform Content for your personal, non-commercial use only, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

By submitting Feedback you grant %%DOMAIN_NAME%% a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable license to use, reproduce, make, sell, modify, and otherwise exploit such Feedback in any manner without compensation to you.</p>
                            <p>We appreciate your input and may incorporate Feedback into the Platform or product roadmap. You acknowledge that other users or third parties may independently develop similar ideas and that we are free to use Feedback without accounting to you.</p>

Each such promotion will be governed by specific rules and eligibility criteria which will be published with the promotion. By participating, you agree to be bound by those rules, as well as these Terms. Promos may have geographic, age, purchase, or other restrictions.</p>
                            <p>We reserve the right to disqualify participants who engage in fraudulent or abusive behavior or who attempt to manipulate a promotion. Winners may be required to provide proof of identity and eligibility. Prizes are non-transferable, subject to availability, and winners are solely responsible for any taxes or other liabilities associated with receiving prizes.</p>
<p>Any dispute relating to a promotion will be governed by the applicable promotion rules and these Terms. Where promotions incorporate third-party platforms or services, additional terms of those third-party providers may apply.</p>
